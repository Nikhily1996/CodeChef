# CodeChef
Hi,
today i started learning about github.
from now  on, i will save all my code chef problem and sols here.
git and svn both are version control systems.
git uses ditrubuted version control system
svn uses centrialized version control system
git has local repository, in svn there is no local repository.
we can check diff,log and commit our code at any time without connecting to internet, since we have local repository
but in svn we cannot do that, we should be connected to internet in order to commit or do anything.
 In Svn we can check out individual file or complete repos, based on our need and implement security to each path seperatly,
 but in git we can to checkout complete repositorty as whole.
 Branching and Merging----git is better than svn, git as better branching model
 --Auditability---You could choose Git or SVN for auditability — as long as you back it up. Making regular backups is highly encouraged with both solutions. You don't want to be on the receiving end of a server crash without a recent copy of your shared server.
 --storage--->SVN is better at storing binary files.
 --Useability---SVN often considered easier to learn. This is especially true for non-technical users. They are able to catch on to common operations quickly.
 
 Short why svn is better than git--?
 SVN is better than Git for architecture performance, binary files, and usability. And it may be better for access control and auditability, based on your needs.
 
 short why git is better than svn
 Git is better than SVN at branching — and it can be better than SVN for access control and auditability, based on your needs
Thanks
